## What is Decentralized Finance?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a new financial paradigm that is built on blockchain technology and enables the creation of financial applications and services that are decentralized and open-source. DeFi has the potential to disrupt the traditional financial system by providing access to financial services to anyone with an internet connection. It allows individuals to interact with financial assets and services directly, without the need for intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions
